Integration with a mock API or backend (e.g., Fake Store API or custom backend)
Client-side routing with React Router
Optimized performance with lazy loading and code splitting (if applicable)



Tech Stack

React: Frontend library for building user interfaces
React Router: For navigation and routing
Redux Toolkit or React Context: For state management
Bootstrap: For responsive and modern UI styling
Axios or Fetch: For making API requests
Vite or Create React App: For project setup and bundling
ESLint and Prettier: For code linting and formatting

Prerequisites
Before running the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Version 16 or higher
npm or yarn: For package management
Git: For cloning the repository

If the application connects to an external API, ensure you have:

API endpoint (e.g., Fake Store API: https://fakestoreapi.com)
Any necessary API keys (if applicable)

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/hanmyintmyat/React-Ecommerce.git


Navigate to the project directory:
cd React-Ecommerce


Install dependencies:
npm install

or
yarn install


Set up environment variables (if applicable):

Create a .env file in the root directory and add necessary variables, e.g.:VITE_API_URL=https://fakestoreapi.com

Note: Update the variable names and values based on the specific API or configuration used.


Run the application:
npm run dev

or
yarn dev


Access the application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified by Vite/Create React App).

Styling with Bootstrap
This project uses Bootstrap for styling, providing a responsive and consistent design across devices. Bootstrap components (e.g., Navbar, Cards, Modals) are used to create a polished UI. Custom styles may be applied in the src/styles directory to override or extend Bootstrap defaults.
To customize Bootstrap:

Modify the src/styles/custom.css file for overrides.
Use Bootstrap utility classes directly in JSX components.
Import Bootstrap in the project (e.g., via CDN or npm):npm install bootstrap

Then import in src/main.jsx or src/index.js:import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';



Deployment
To deploy the application:

Build the project for production:
npm run build

or
yarn build


Deploy the generated dist folder to a static hosting platform like:

Vercel
Netlify
GitHub Pages


If the application relies on a backend, ensure the backend API is deployed and the frontend is configured to use the correct API URL.


Example deployment command for Vercel:
vercel
