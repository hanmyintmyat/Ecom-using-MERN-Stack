Styling with Bootstrap
This project uses Bootstrap for styling, providing a responsive and consistent design across devices. Bootstrap components (e.g., Navbar, Cards, Modals) are used to create a polished UI. Custom styles may be applied in the src/styles directory to override or extend Bootstrap defaults.
To customize Bootstrap:

Modify the src/styles/custom.css file for overrides.
Use Bootstrap utility classes directly in JSX components.
Import Bootstrap in the project (e.g., via CDN or npm):npm install bootstrap

Then import in src/main.jsx or src/index.js:import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';



Deployment
To deploy the application:

Build the project for production:
npm run build

or
yarn build


Deploy the generated dist folder to a static hosting platform like:

Vercel
Netlify
GitHub Pages
